        # Example steps (pseudo-code):
        # 1. For each person, try to find their LinkedIn URL
        # 2. Scrape the LinkedIn page
        # 3. Extract data (e.g., job title, summary, etc.)
        # 4. Populate the Person object
        #
        # This requires careful handling of LinkedIn's ToS, as well as
        # potential use of LinkedIn's APIs or a specialized scraping approach.
        #
        # For demonstration, letâ€™s just simulate we found a LinkedIn URL and personality score:
        for p in persons_list:
            # Pretend we found some URL on LinkedIn
            fake_linkedin_url = f"https://www.linkedin.com/in/{p.name.replace(' ', '-').lower()}/"
            p.set_linkedin_profile(fake_linkedin_url)
